# üå© Hybrid BiLSTM + Quantum CNN + Reinforcement Learning for Cloudburst Prediction

## üìå Overview
This project implements a **hybrid deep learning model** combining:
- **BiLSTM (Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory)** ‚Äì for temporal sequence learning
- **Quantum CNN (Quantum Convolutional Neural Network)** ‚Äì for enhanced feature extraction using quantum computing concepts
- **Reinforcement Learning Agent** ‚Äì for adaptive model tuning and decision-making

The goal is to predict **cloudburst events** using meteorological data and advanced AI techniques.  
The dataset includes both **high-risk** and **low-risk** weather samples with parameters such as:
- Temperature
- Humidity
- Pressure
- Wind Speed
- Cloud Cover
- Ground Level Pressure

The model is capable of:
1. Training and evaluating prediction accuracy
2. Outputting **training accuracy** without retraining
3. Outputting **testing accuracy** after evaluation
